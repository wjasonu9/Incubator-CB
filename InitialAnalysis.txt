I sought to analyze data from the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Blossom_Ten_Mile_Run).  This is a 10-mile road race taking place yearly on the first Sunday of April in Washington, DC.  As an acknowledgment, I followed many of the guidelines for scraping these data from the web and then cleaning it from Chapter 2 of "Data Science in R" by Nolan and Temple Lang.
