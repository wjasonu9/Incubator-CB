The data originate from http://www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results_list.php.  Data for both men and women are available for the years 1999 to 2012.  To view it, click eg "2012 Race Results", and then click "Order of Finish - Women Ten Mile Run" which displays the table.  We take note of the URL of this page, from which we can use R to scrape these data and clean them before saving the contents as a file called "cb12-w.txt" in this directory.  2012 Race data for men, and race results for both genders from other years, are accessed similarly, saved to txt files, and given corresponding names.

Relevant variables we plan to use are the runner's name, age, hometown, 5 mile time, and 10 mile (overall) time.  The 5 mile time is only available in the 2008 and 2009-12 datasets (2007 has 10 km times).  Sometimes the 10 mile time is simply called "Time", while other times it could be called something along the lines of "Gun Time" or "Net Time".  When there is a distinction, we go with "Net Time" because it is more accurate according to the website.  This process gives us 70000+ observations per gender of race data over the 14 years where the race results are available as html tables.
